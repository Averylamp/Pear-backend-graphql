# GraphQL-MongoDB

All the important starting code is in `src/start.js`.
Models and the schema representation is split up in files in `src/models`

Install, build and run development server:

```
npm install
yarn startdev
```

To set up linting scripts run from root project folder: 
```
cp pre-commit .git/hooks
```

You shouldn't be able to push directly to master; instead, create and merge PRs.
